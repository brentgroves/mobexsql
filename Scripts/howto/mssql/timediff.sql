SQL Server DATEDIFF() overview
To calculate the difference between two dates in years, months, weeks, etc., you use the DATEDIFF() function:

DATEDIFF( date_part , start_date , end_date)
Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) (sql)
The DATEDIFF() function accepts three arguments: date_part, start_date, and end_date.

date_part is the part of date e.g., a year, a quarter, a month, a week that you want to compare between the start_date and end_date. See the valid date parts in the table below.
start_date and end_date are the dates to be compared. They must be resolved to values of type DATE, DATETIME, DATETIMEOFFSET, DATETIME2, SMALLATETIME, or TIME.
The following table lists the valid values of date_part:

date_part	abbreviations
year	yy, yyyy
quarter	qq, q
month	mm, m
dayofyear	dy, y
day	dd, d
week	wk, ww
hour	hh
minute	mi, n
second	ss, s
millisecond	ms
microsecond	mcs
nanosecond	ns
The DATEDIFF() function returns a value of integer indicating the difference between the start_date and end_date, with the unit specified by date_part.

The DATEDIFF() function returns an error if the result is out of range for integer (-2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647). In this case, you should use the DATEDIFF_BIG() function instead.

SQL Server DATEDIFF() function examples
Letâ€™s take some examples of using the DATEDIFF() function to understand it better.

A) Using DATEDIFF() function to compare the differences between two date values
This example uses the DATEDIFF() function to compare the difference between two dates in various date parts:

DECLARE 
    @start_dt DATETIME2= '2019-12-31 23:59:59.9999999', 
    @end_dt DATETIME2= '2020-01-01 00:00:00.0000000';

SELECT 
    DATEDIFF(year, @start_dt, @end_dt) diff_in_year, 
    DATEDIFF(quarter, @start_dt, @end_dt) diff_in_quarter, 
    DATEDIFF(month, @start_dt, @end_dt) diff_in_month, 
    DATEDIFF(dayofyear, @start_dt, @end_dt) diff_in_dayofyear, 
    DATEDIFF(day, @start_dt, @end_dt) diff_in_day, 
    DATEDIFF(week, @start_dt, @end_dt) diff_in_week, 
    DATEDIFF(hour, @start_dt, @end_dt) diff_in_hour, 
    DATEDIFF(minute, @start_dt, @end_dt) diff_in_minute, 
    DATEDIFF(second, @start_dt, @end_dt) diff_in_second, 
    DATEDIFF(millisecond, @start_dt, @end_dt) diff_in_millisecond;
